### Classic Pot Roast and Potatoes
* **Serves:** 6-8
* **Cooking Time:** ?
* **Description**: 
The typical 4-hour cooking time plus prep and rest makes pot roast an unlikely candidate even on weekends for today's ooks.  This pressure-cooker version makes it an easy weekend dinner.  Adding potatoes seemed essential and a few tricks guaranteed perfection.  Adding them to the pot after the roast meant the slower cooking meat was closest to the heat source.  Large potatoes broke down during cooking, but potatoes measuring 1 to 3 inches held together.  We flavorted our braising liquid (beef broth) with tomato paste and dried porcini mushrooms (both boosters of meaty flavor) and used this braising liquid as our sauce.
