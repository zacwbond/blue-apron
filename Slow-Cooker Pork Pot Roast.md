### Slow-Cooker Pork Pot Roast

* **Serves:** 8

* **Description**: 
 Beef shoulder is the classic choice for pot roast recipes, but we wondered whether pork shoulder could be used as a worthy substitute. After all, pork shoulder’s fat content and marbling are similar to beef chuck’s, meaning it requires the same low-and-slow cooking to become tender. But when we tested this theory in our Slow-Cooker Pork Pot Roast recipe, we ended up with watery, thin sauce, while the potent flavors of red wine, beef broth, and canned tomatoes completely overwhelmed the flavor of the pork. For the full-flavored Slow-Cooker Pork Pot Roast recipe that we were after, we eliminated the broth and cut back on the amount of wine and tomato juice we added. A small amount of instant tapioca produced just the right thick texture for the sauce. And to lighten the flavor of the sauce, we switched from red wine to white wine, adding a splash of white wine vinegar at the end of cooking to refresh the wine flavor.
