### Four Cheese Lasagna
* **Serves:** 6-8
* **Cooking Time:** ?
* **Description**: 
 For a silky sauce with great cheese flavor, we use two cheeses: Monterey Jack for smooth meltability and sharp cheddar for potent flavor. We melt the cheeses into a béchamel sauce—milk thickened with a flour and butter roux—and then add the precooked pasta and let it heat through on the stovetop. Baking macaroni and cheese can lead to curdled cheese and broken sauce, but since ours is already piping hot when it goes into the baking dish, it needs only a few minutes under the broiler to crisp up the buttery crumb topping.

The test kitchen’s favorite elbow macaroni is Barilla Elbows. Serve with hot sauce and/or celery salt.
