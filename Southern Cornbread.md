### Southern Cornbread

* **Serves:** 4
* **Cooking Time:** ?
* **Description**: 
 Unlike its sweet, cakey Northern counterpart, Southern cornbread is thin, crusty, and decidedly savory. Though some styles of Southern cornbread are dry and crumbly, I favor this dense, moist, tender version. Cornmeal mush of just the right texture is essential to this bread. Though I prefer to make cornbread in a preheated cast-iron skillet, a 9-inch round cake pan or 9-inch square baking pan, greased lightly with butter and not preheated, will also produce acceptable results if you double the recipe and bake the bread for 25 minutes.  The mush should be like soft polenta: thick enough to give the batter body, but pliable enough to stir wet ingredients in easily.
