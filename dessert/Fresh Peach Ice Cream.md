### Fresh Peach Ice Cream

* **Serves:** 4

* **Description**: 
 For our peach ice cream recipe, we found that the preparation of the peaches and syrup was key: Letting the peaches stand for a bit with the sugar, then cooking them gently, then straining them, adding the syrupy juice to the custard before churning, and adding the peaches themselves near the end of churning gave us a smooth, creamy, and very peachy ice cream. Both the cooked peaches and the custard mixture must be cooled to 40 degrees before you churn them. Since they are fine in the refrigerator overnight, you may want to prepare them the day before you plan to churn and serve the ice cream. You’ll get the very best results from using in-season, fully ripened peaches, but in a pinch, you can substitute 2 cups IQF (individually quick frozen) sliced peaches and replace the vodka with peach-flavored liqueur. The ice cream is at its peak when eaten within four hours of churning, although covered, it will keep in the freezer for up to two days.
