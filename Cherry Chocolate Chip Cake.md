### Cherry Chocolate Chip Cake
* **Cooking Time:** ?
* **Description**: 
 Why this recipe works: We developed a recipe for White Layer Cake that bakes up moist, tender, and flavorful, rather than dry and bland. We used a reverse creaming method for a sturdy cake with a tender crumb. Plenty of butter and vanilla extract add moisture and flavor to our White Layer Cake.

 Cherry Chocolate Chip Cake is a homespun cake that tastes like chocolate-covered cherries, and is the perfect treat to celebrate Valentine’s Day. Most recipes add mini chocolate chips and maraschino cherries to the batter, but we found that the cherries in canned pie filling tasted better than maraschino cherries, which we reserved for our Cherry Chocolate Chip Cake’s garnish. Draining the jarred cherries and drying them with paper towels ensured the melted chocolate in our recipe adhered to them well.  If you’ve forgotten to bring the milk and egg white mixture to room temperature, set the bottom of the measuring cup containing it in a sink of hot water and stir until the mixture feels cool rather than cold, around 65 degrees. Cake layers can be wrapped and stored for one day.

 Traditional European buttercream frosting involves heating eggs and sugar over a pan of simmering water, and whipping in butter while carefully monitoring for the correct temperature. Our Easy Vanilla Buttercream recipe is equally delicious, and much less fussy. It is also the canvas for almost any variation imaginable.
