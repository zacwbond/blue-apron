### Whole-Grain Mustard

* **Cooking Time:** ?
* **Description**: 
 Homemade mustard is easy to prepare and packs a lot more punch than the store-bought stuff. For our recipe, we start with a 1:1 ratio of milder yellow mustard seeds to more pungent, spicier brown seeds. A little brown sugar tempers the mustard seeds’ bite while cider vinegar (rather than straightforward white vinegar) adds complexity. We soak the seeds before processing them in a food processor with the other ingredients. This step not only softens the seeds but also ensures that they break down evenly when processed. Reserving ½ cup of the soaked seeds and stirring them back into the pureed mustard gives it an appealingly grainy consistency. If sampled right after mixing, the mustard might taste a little bitter. We found it best to let the mustard “ripen” on the counter for a few days to allow bitter compounds to dissipate and spicy ones to develop. Refrigeration will halt these enzymatic reactions, so chill it once it reaches your desired heat level.
