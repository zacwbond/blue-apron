### Icebox Straweberry Pie

* **Serves:** 6 to 8
* **Cooking Time:** ?
* **Description**:
 Don’t be fooled by the army green color of these “green” beans. The flavorful broth they are cooked in imparts both onion and bacon flavor in every bite, and the long simmer works to make the green beans sweet and full flavored. If you use thick-cut bacon, cut the amount to four slices, browning two and reserving the other two to cook in the beans. You can use the prepared green beans in the microwave bags from your supermarket, but be sure to trim both ends. When slicing the onion, remove all of the root so that the onion pieces fall into strings when sliced.
