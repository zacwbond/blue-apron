### Creamy Tomato Soup
* **Serves:** 4
* **Cooking Time:** ?
* **Description**: 
 We wanted a creamy tomato soup recipe that would have velvety smoothness and a bright tomatoey taste, without added cream. We started with canned tomatoes because they had better flavor than supermarket tomatoes and were already peeled. Finding that butter muted the tomato flavor, we swapped it for olive oil when sautéing our onion and garlic. A little brown sugar toned down acidity, and a surprise ingredient—a slice of white bread torn into pieces—helped give our tomato soup recipe body without added cream.
 If half of the soup fills your blender by more than two-thirds, process the soup in three batches. You can also use an immersion blender to process the soup directly in the pot. For an even smoother soup, pass the pureed mixture through a fine-mesh strainer before stirring in the chicken broth in step 2. Serve this soup with Grilled Cheese Sandwiches for a Crowd or topped with Butter Croutons (see related recipes)
