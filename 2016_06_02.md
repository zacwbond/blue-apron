* **Makes:** 2 Servings

* **Description**: 
 This classic stir-fry gets its signature flavor from yellow curry powder, which imbues the dish with warm, savory flavor (and tints it a distinctive yellow). Here, we’re pairing vermicelli—exceptionally fine rice noodles—with delectable, seasonal vegetables. Slicing the snow peas and yellow squash into thin strips allows them to cook more quickly and blend in seamlessly with the noodles.
