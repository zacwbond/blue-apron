### Potato Salad

* **Serves:** 4-6
* **Cooking Time:** ?
* **Description**: To make a flavorful potato salad, with properly cooked potatoes, we started by simmering 3/4-inch chunks of Yukon Gold potatoes in salted water until just tender, 10 to 15 minutes. To continue the seasoning process, we drizzled a mixture of dill pickle brine and mustard over the hot potatoes to absorb flavor while cooling. For the next flavor stage, we combined mayonnaise with onion, celery, celery seeds, white vinegar, chopped pickles and more of their brine, salt, and pepper. We tossed the cooled potatoes with the dressing to thoroughly combine. Refrigerating the salad for at least 30 minutes before serving helps meld the flavors.  Salad can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.
