### Chicken Noodle Casserole

* **Serves:** 8-10
* **Cooking Time:** ?
* **Description**: 
 To update this retro dish, we started by ditching the canned ingredients and condensed soup. A flour-thickened sauce made up of chicken broth and half-and-half creates a rich, savory base, and a combination of cheeses—cheddar for flavor, American for smooth melting—is key. Precooked chicken turned rubbery after being baked into the casserole, so we simmer boneless, skinless chicken breasts in the sauce until they’re nearly cooked through before shredding them and tossing them in with the noodles—also cooked to just al dente. Buttery Ritz Crackers become a quick, crunchy topping for the casserole.  Cooking the egg noodles until just al dente and then shocking them in cold water prevents them from overcooking.
