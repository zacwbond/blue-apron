* **Description**: 
 Though the ingredients may sound funny, Dr Pepper-Glazed Ham is a recipe that works. The fruity soda lends complexity and a real bite to the typically sweet, one-dimensional glaze applied to smoked hams. We combined the Dr Pepper with orange juice and mustard for even more complexity of flavor. To ensure the ham stayed moist, we cooked it in an oven bag, baking it until just warmed through.
