### Roasted Cauliflower

* **Serves:** 4-6
* **Cooking Time:** ?
* **Description**: 
 We wanted to add flavor to cauliflower without drowning it in a heavy blanket of cheese sauce, so we developed a roasted cauliflower recipe that gave us cauliflower with a golden exterior and a creamy interior. We discovered that steaming (in a covered sheet pan) followed by roasting produced nicely caramelized cauliflower with a creamy texture.  This dish stands well on its own, drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil, or with any of the following sauces. Also, some tasters liked spiced versions made with either curry powder or chili powder. Simply stir 2 teaspoons of either spice into the oil before seasoning the cauliflower.
