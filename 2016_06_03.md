* **Description**: 
 Hearty, pillowy gnocchi pair beautifully with pesto, a versatile green sauce from Italian cuisine. Before tossing our gnocchi with a fresh pesto of spinach, almonds, capers and more, we’re sautéing them (alongside asparagus) in a pan of browned butter, for a layer of rich, nutty flavor. Their tender bite finds a delicious counterpoint in the delicate crunch of the asparagus.
