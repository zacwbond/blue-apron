* **Description**: 
 In this seasonal, Middle Eastern-inspired grain salad, we’re showcasing two parts of the pea plant: the hearty leaves and the bright peas themselves, which we’re blanching (or quickly boiling, then rinsing under cold water) for perfect tenderness. As a tangy-sweet accent for the peas and fennel, we’re dressing the salad with pomegranate molasses—a rich, concentrated syrup made by boiling down the fruit’s juice.
