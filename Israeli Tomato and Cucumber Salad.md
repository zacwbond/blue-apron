### Israeli Tomato and Cucumber Salad

* **Serves:** 6
* **Cooking Time:** ?
* **Description**: 
 We wanted to come up with a simple summer tomato salad recipe that would make the most of (and use up) some of the tomato bounty from the garden. We managed it without too much trouble, discovering that salting the tomatoes before mixing them into the salad brings out their juices, which make a great base for the dressing. We also discovered there's no need to peel homegrown tomatoes for a tomato salad recipe, because their skins are usually thin and unobtrusive.  Thin-skinned English cucumbers, with or without the peel, work well in this salad.
