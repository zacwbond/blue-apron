### Honey Roasted Chicken

* **Serves:** 6-8
* **Cooking Time:** ?
* **Description**: 
 To ensure our Honey Roast Chicken recipe was nicely seasoned through and through, we rubbed both the skin and meat with a mixture of salt, pepper, and paprika. We waited until the chicken was almost done before coating it with a honey–cider vinegar glaze. That kept the skin crisp, but didn’t have time to burn. Unfortunately, our glaze kept dripping onto our roasting pan, where it sizzled and burned. We avoided this by adding water and chicken broth to the pan, which later served as the base for a flavorful sauce.
