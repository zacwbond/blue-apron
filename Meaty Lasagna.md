### Meaty Lasagna
* **Cooking Time:** ?
* **Description**: 
 We wanted a lasagna recipe that would deliver a rich and meaty weeknight meal that we didnâ€™t need to defrost before putting in the oven. To achieve this, we used no-boil noodles, which are precooked and dehydrated before packaging, so they freeze well and bake up tender but never mushy. And to ensure our meaty lasagna recipe held up to the punishing effects of the freezer, we bulked up the flavors by replacing some of the ground beef with ground pork and increasing the amount of crushed red pepper flakes and fresh basil.
