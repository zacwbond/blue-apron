### Monkey Bread
* **Serves:** 6-8
* **Cooking Time:** ?
* **Description**: 
 We wanted a faster recipe for monkey bread that didn't compromise on its delicious flavor. To expedite the rising and proofing in this recipe we used a large amount of instant yeast and added sugar to the dough. Butter and milk helped keep the monkey bread dough rich and flavorful. We rolled the dough in butter and sugar to help give the monkey bread a thick, caramellike coating. The monkey bread is best served warm.

The dough should be sticky, but if you find that it's too wet and not coming together in the mixer, add 2 tablespoons more flour and mix until the dough forms a cohesive mass. Make sure to use light brown sugar in the sugar mix; dark brown sugar has a stronger molasses flavor that can be overwhelming. After baking, don't let the bread cool in the pan for more than 5 minutes or it will stick to the pan and come out in pieces. Monkey Bread is at its best when served warm.
