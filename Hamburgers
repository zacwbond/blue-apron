### Grilled Hamburgers

* **Serves:** 4
* **Cooking Time:** ?
* **Description**: 
 For a moist, juicy hamburger recipe with a tender and cohesive texture, we preferred chuck ground to order, with a ratio of fat to lean of 20 percent fat:80 percent lean. We formed the meat into 6-ounce patties with a depression in the middle (to 1/2 inch) to keep the burgers from puffing up when they cooked.
