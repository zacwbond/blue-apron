### Brussels Sprouts with Garlic and Pine Nuts

* **Description**: 
 When looking for the best and simplest Brussels sprouts recipe, we settled on braising, which produced tender, not-too-bitter, attractively green-colored Brussels sprouts with little fuss. Because braising in water was so successful, we tried braising in other liquids as well.  This is an especially good way to prepare brussels sprouts for those unsure of their liking for this vegetable. When buying Brussels sprouts, choose those with small, tight heads, no more than 1 1/2 inches in diameter, for the best flavor. Larger sprouts can often be trimmed of loose leaves along the stem and still be quite good; they cook best when cut in half.
