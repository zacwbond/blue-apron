### Black-Eyed Peas and Greens
* **Serves:** 6-8
* **Cooking Time:** ?
* **Description**: 
 To speed up this Southern one-pot dish (traditionally served on New Yearâ€™s), we swapped dried legumes for a couple cans of black-eyed peas. A 15-minute head start on the stove gives the greens plenty of time to tenderize without turning the peas to mush. With no time to draw flavor out of a hambone, we rely on smoky bacon and savory chicken broth for a meaty backbone. Canned tomatoes, a handful of aromatics and spices, and a tablespoon each of vinegar and sugar balance the flavors and round out this hearty dish.

Don't crush the peas--stir gently.
