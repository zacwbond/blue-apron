### Fluffy White Rice

* **Description**: 
 Our best long-grain white rice recipe employed the pilaf method. We found that saut√©ing the rice in oil or butter before covering it with water added a rich dimension of flavor. The water was then brought to a boil before the pan was covered and the heat reduced to let the rice simmer for 15 minutes. After a brief rest off the heat, the rice was fluffy and ready to serve, with tender yet separate grains.  This recipe is designed for one cup of raw rice in a tight-lidded pot. As you cook more rice, you should reduce the proportion of water. With two cups of rice, you can get these results with two and one-half to two and three-quarters cups of water. But it is very hard to get a reliable result with less than a cup of rice, so do not halve this recipe.
