### Braised Winter Greens
* **Serves:** 4

* **Description**: 
 We wanted a one-pot winter greens recipe with no parcooking. To achieve this, we sautéed half of the greens before adding the rest with a little bit of liquid and covered the pot. When the greens had almost the tender-firm texture we wanted, we removed the lid to allow the liquid to cook off. The result: a winter greens recipe that highlights the greens’ cabbagelike flavor and firm texture.

For best results, be sure your greens are fully cooked and tender in step 1 before moving on to step 2.
