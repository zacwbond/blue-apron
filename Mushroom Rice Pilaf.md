### Mushroom Rice Pilaf

* **Serves:** 4-6
* **Cooking Time:** ?
* **Description**: 
 Rather than stick to the standard ratio of two parts liquid to one part rice, we discovered that slightly less liquid produced a perfect pilaf with fluffy grains. Sautéing the rice in a little butter added more flavor than oil, and replacing water with chicken broth made our pilaf more savory. We added earthy mushrooms, some poultry seasoning, and minced fresh thyme to create a welcome accompaniment to any entrée.
