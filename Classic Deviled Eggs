### Classic Deviled Eggs

* **Description**: 
 When we set out to develop a deviled egg recipe, we had in mind the deviled eggs of our childhood: perfectly cooked nests of egg whites cradling a creamy filling, made with simple ingredients and quickly whipped together. To achieve that ideal, we started with perfectly hard cooked eggs, then made a filling with the yolks, mayonnaise, cracked country-style mustard, cider vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. Filling the eggs as close to serving as possible gave our deviled egg recipe a fresh, bright flavor.  The empty egg halves and filling can be refrigerated separately, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, for up to 2 days. Bring to room temperature and season the filling with additional mayonnaise, vinegar, salt, and pepper to taste before filling.
