### Pan-Fried Fresh Salmon Cakes

* **Serves:** 6
* **Cooking Time:** ?
* **Description**: 
 For a salmon cake recipe that would produce crisp, browned, bright-flavored cakes, we chopped fresh fillets by hand, used a bit of mayonnaise as a binder and fresh bread crumbs for texture, and flavored the cakes with a simple combination of onion, lemon juice, and parsley. Freezing the salmon cakes for 15 minutes before breading made them easier to handle and helped the breading to adhere.  A big wedge of lemon is the simplest accompaniment to salmon cakes, but if you decide to go with dipping sauce, make it before preparing the cakes so the sauce flavors have time to meld. If possible, use panko (Japanese bread crumbs).
