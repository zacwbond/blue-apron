* **Description**: 
 For a pumpkin pie recipe that produced a pie with a crisp crust and a soft, custard-type filling, we began baking our crusts almost completely before filling them; that way we knew they would start out crisp. Next, we made sure that both shell and filling for our pumpkin pie recipe were hot when we assembled the pie, so the custard could begin to firm up almost immediately rather than soaking into the pastry. Finally, we baked the pie quickly, in the bottom of the oven, exposing the bottom of the crust to the most intense heat. We avoided curdling by taking the pie out of the oven immediately once the center thickened to the point where it no longer sloshed but instead wiggled like gelatin when the pan was gently shaken.
 
2cups plain pumpkin puree (16 ounces), canned or fresh
1cup packed dark brown sugar
2teaspoons ground ginger
1teaspoon fresh grated nutmeg
2teaspoons ground cinnamon
¼teaspoon ground cloves
½teaspoon table salt
⅔cup heavy cream
⅔cup milk
4 large eggs


 
-----
*Ingredients:*
* 1 prepared pie crust
* 1 C heavy cream
* 1 C whole milk
* 3 eggs
* 2 egg yolks
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1 can pumpkin (15 oz.)
* 1 C drained candied yams
* 3/4 C sugar
* 1/4 C maple syrup
* 2 tsp fresh ginger
* 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
* 1 tsp table salt

8. For filling: Process pumpkin, brown sugar, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt in a food processor fitted with steel blade for 1 minute. Transfer pumpkin mixture to a 3-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan; bring it to a sputtering simmer over medium-high heat. Cook pumpkin, stirring constantly, until thick and shiny, about 5 minutes. As soon as pie shell comes out of oven, whisk heavy cream and milk into pumpkin and bring to a bare simmer. Process eggs in food processor until whites and yolks are mixed, about 5 seconds. With motor running, slowly pour about half of hot pumpkin mixture through feed tube. Stop machine and scrape in remaining pumpkin. Process 30 seconds longer.

9. Immediately pour warm filling into hot pie shell. (Ladle any excess filling into pie after it has baked for 5 minutes or so — by this time filling will have settled.) Bake until filling is puffed, dry-looking, and lightly cracked around edges, and center wiggles like gelatin when pie is gently shaken, about 25 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour.
