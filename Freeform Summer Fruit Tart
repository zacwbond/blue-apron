### Freeform Summer Fruit Tart

* **Serves:** 4
* **Cooking Time:** ?
* **Description**: We developed our free-form tart recipe as a quick alternative to pie. For the flakiest pastry, we turned to a French technique in pastry making called fraisage, in which the dough is smeared with the heel of your hand, spreading the butter pieces into long, thin streaks between skeletal layers of flour and water. The dough is then lifted up and back over the fruit (the center of the tart remains exposed) and loosely pleated to allow for shrinkage. The bright summer fruit needed only the simple addition of sugar, 3 to 5 tablespoons depending on the type of fruit.  Though we prefer the tart made with a mix of stone fruits and berries (our favorite combinations were plums and raspberries, peaches and blueberries, and apricots and blackberries), you can use only one type of fruit if you prefer. Peeling the stone fruit (even the peaches) is not necessary. Taste the fruit before adding sugar to it; use the lesser amount if the fruit is very sweet, more if it is tart. However much sugar you use, do not add it to the fruit until you are ready to fill and form the tart. Once baked, the tart is best eaten warm, or within 3 or 4 hours, although leftovers do reheat well in a 350-degree oven. Excellent accompaniments are vanilla ice cream or lightly sweetened whipped cream or crème fraîche.  Note: The amount of water that the dough will require depends on the ambient humidity; in a dry environment, it may need more water, in a humid environment, less. The dough can be made ahead and refrigerated overnight or tightly wrapped in two sheets of plastic wrap and frozen for up to one week. If at any point the dough becomes soft, sticky, and dificult to work with during rolling, chill it until it becomes workable.

*Ingredients:*
* 1 1/2 C unbleached AP flour (7 1/2 oz.)
* 1/2 tsp table salt
* 10 tbsp unsalted butter (1 1/4 sticks): cold, cut into 1/2 in. cubes
* 3-6 tbsp water: ice cold

*Steps:*
* pulse flour and salt to combine in food processor (3 pulses)
* scatter butter over flour and pulse into coars crumb with pea-sized butter (10-12 pulses)
* sprinkle 1 tbsp water and pulse
* repeat sprinkling until water forms curds and holds together when pinched
* spread crumbly dough out on work surface (sprinkle water and fluff if too dry)
* gather dough with a scraper into a mound 12 in. long by 4 in. wide, perpendicular to counter
* use heel of your hand to smear dough away from you, starting at the farthest end
* once all dough is smeared, gather with bench scraper and repeat until cohesive (~1 repeat)
* form dough into 4-in disk, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate until firm but malleable (~1h)


*Ingredients:*
* 1 lb stone fruit (peaches, etc.): pitted, cut into 1/2 in. wedges
* 1 C berries (~1/2 dry pint): gently washed
* *dough*

*Steps:*
* combine fruit in a bowl
* let dough stand if needed if it is too hard to work with (~15-20m)
* spread flour on parchment paper
* roll dough into a 12 in. round, 3/16 in. thick
* regrigerate on baking sheet until firm but pliant (15-30m)

*Ingredients:*
* *fruit*
* *rolled dough*
* 3-5 tbsp sugar: depends on tartness of fruit
* 1 tbsp water: for brushing
* 1 tbsp sugar: for sprinkling

*Steps:*
* heat oven to 400 degrees with rack in lower middle position.
* sprinkle fruit with sugar and toss to combine
* mound fruit on dough, leaving a 2 1/2 in. border
* fold outer 2 in., leaving a 1/2 in. pocket free of fruit inside the fold
* repeat, overlapping dough every 2-3 in., pinch-pleating to secure
* brush dough with water and sprinkle evenly with 1 tbsp. sugar
* bake until crust is deep golden brown and fruit is bubbling (50-55m)
* cool baking sheet on wire rack (10m)
* loosen and remove tart to bare wire rack and cool (~30m-1h)
