### Dakota Peach Kuchen

* **Serves:** 8
* **Cooking Time:** ?
* **Description**: 
 This combination of rich yeasted dough, creamy custard, and fresh fruit is a coffee cake that comes to us via South Dakota. To make the rich dough turn out light and tender, we let the dough rise and then let it rest in the fridge before we shape it into two rounds. Another rise ensures maximum flavor and lightness. We enrich our cream-based custard with an extra egg yolk and flavor it with vanilla extract. After pressing the doughs down into two cake pans, we fill them with the custard and sliced peaches. A sprinkling of cinnamon is the finishing touch before the kuchens go into the oven.
