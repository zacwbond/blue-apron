* **Serves:** 8
* **Cooking Time:** ?
* **Description**:
 In step 1, it is imperative that the cooked strawberry mixture measures 2 cups; any more and the filling will be loose. If your fresh berries arenâ€™t fully ripe, you may want to add extra sugar to taste in step 2. Use your favorite pie dough or use our recipe. Chill the heavy cream to help it whip more quickly.
