Makes: 2 Servings

Calories: About 590 Per Serving

Cooking Time: 30 to 40 minutes

A popular breakfast in the Middle East, shakshuka traditionally comprises eggs poached in a delicious sauce of tomatoes and spices. For dinner tonight, we’re turning the red sauce green—with tangy roasted tomatillos and eight ball squash, a spherical summer variety similar to zucchini. For more dynamic flavor, we’re using za’atar to season the shakshuka and our oven-baked pita chips (perfect for scooping up the sauce).
